Dear C++ Developers,
I am seeking your expertise to expand and enhance our Student Management System. The 
current implementation covers basic functionalities such as adding students, managing grades 
and attendance, generating reports, and sorting student data. However, we aim to build a more 
robust system with additional features like advanced data analysis, integration with other 
educational tools, and a more user-friendly interface. Your contributions can significantly improve 
the efficiency and effectiveness of this system, making it an invaluable tool for educators and 
administrators. Any suggestions, enhancements, or additional functionalities you can provide will 
be highly appreciated. Thank you for your support and collaboration.
